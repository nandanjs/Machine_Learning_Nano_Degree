    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression model: ** One of the real-world applications of a Logistic Regression model is in lending business where the lender is interested in knowing what is the likelihood of the customer defaulting on his loan. The training data in this case would be having a binary target variable (whether the customer defaults or not) whereas the lender is actually interested in getting the output in terms of probability which he can use for rank ordering the customers based on thier riskiness and can have customized strategies for them. Logistic Regression fits perfectly in this kind of a problem where it takes a binary outcome for training and gives a continuous probabilistic estimate of the output. Some of the biggest strengths of a logistic regression model are that its output has a nice probabilistic interpretation, the algorithm can be easily regularized to avoid overfitting and the models can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent.[https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms]\n",
    "Logistic models have weaknesses as well for e.g. they will underperform when multi collinearity exists in the input data or if the classes are not linearly separable. Logistic models also tend to not work so well if the number of features are very large. In this particular problem since the data the already preprocessed and number of features are not so huge we can go ahead and try logistic regression model here. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest classifier: ** One of the real world applications of Random Forests that I came across was in the area of detection of diabetic retinopathy where a random forests based classifer was used to analyze fundus photography data of retina and classify whether it is the case of diabetic retinopathy or not.[Casanova R, Saldana S, Chew EY, Danis RP, Greven CM, Ambrosius WT. Application of Random Forests Methods to Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Analyses. Zheng Y, ed. PLoS ONE. 2014;9(6):e98587. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0098587.]\n",
    "Some of the key strengths of the random forests classifers are that it can easily handle large number of predictors even with smaller training dataset and are robust to outlier. Random forests also can naturally model non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "Some of the weaknesses includes overfitting to training data and large time required to train the model if large dataset it used that has very large number of predictors. \n",
    "Generally random forests classifiers have found to have good accuracy with classification problems and given their ability to even capture non linear boundaries they can be used for this particular problem.\n",

    "One of the biggest advantages of SVMs is that they can model non-linear decision boundaries using different kernel tricks. They are also fairly robust against overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space.[https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms]. \n",
    "One of the drawbacks of SVMs is that they are very sensitive to noise. Even a small number of mislabeled examples can significantly decrease the performance. Also they require more time for training data as compared to other algorithms. \n",

The way a logistic regression model will work in this case is that it will estimate the likelihood (probability) of an individual earning more than \\$50,000 based on certain specific information about that individual provided as the input to the model. In order for model to make more accurate predictions, it is trained using the data from past having information about the individuals and specifying which of those individuals had income of more than \\$50,000. Based on this information, the model tries to identify the relationship between various input factors and the outcome that we want to predict. Examples of input factors in this case would be specific information about the individuals like their age, education level, occupation and working class, number of working hours, etc. The output of the model will be a probability value for each individual indicating how likely that individual must be making more than \\$50,000. For e.g. lets say the model predicts 0.8 for an individual, this means we are 80% confident that this person earns more than $50,000"

Age was the most important factor identfied by the model which makes sense as the age of person can tell how his experience and ability to work. The other two variables indentified by the model are relationship_husband and marital-status_married-civ-spouse. Relationship-husband could be an important factor in case if the wife is dependent on husband and also marital status could also be an important factor depending on whether the spouse is a civilian or with the armed forces.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** From the above results we can see that both accuracy score and the F-score has significantly dropped after reducing the number of variables. This means that the remaning variables that were dropped from the model were playing an important role. Even if the training time was a factor I would still not consider dropping those varialbes as we can clearly see that it is affecting the prediction power of the model. Instead of dropping the variables I would go for reducing the sample size for model training instead of using the entire dataset to reduce the training time."
